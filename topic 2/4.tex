\section*{Task 2.4}

\subsection*{Task statement}
What is the most general solution of $\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T - C)$?

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{dT}{dt} & = k(T - C) \\
        dT & = k(T - C)dt \\
        \frac{dT}{T - C} & = kdt,\ T \neq C \\
        \ln{|T - C|} & = kt + C_1 \\
        T & = C_1 e^{kt} + C
    \end{aligned}
\end{displaymath}

While I was solving the equation, I said that $T \neq C$. This solution is obtained when $C_1 = 0$. Hence this solution is the most general.

\subsection*{Answer}

The most general solution is: $T = C_1 e^{kt} + C$.
