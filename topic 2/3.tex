\section*{Task 2.3}

\subsection*{Task statement}
What is the most general solution of $\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T - 20)$?

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{dT}{dt} & = k(T - 20) \\
        dT & = k(T - 20)dt \\
        \frac{dT}{T - 20} & = kdt,\ T \neq 20 \\
        \ln{|T - 20|} & = kt + C \\
        T & = C e^{kt} + 20
    \end{aligned}
\end{displaymath}

While I was solving the equation, I said that $T \neq 20$. This solution is obtained when $C = 0$. Hence this solution is the most general.

\subsection*{Answer}

The most general solution is: $T = C e^{kt} + 20$.
