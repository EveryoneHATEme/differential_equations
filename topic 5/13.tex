\section*{Task 5.13}

\subsection*{Task statement}

Show that the equation $y'' - 2y' - 8y = 0$ has a general solution $y = C_1 e^{4x} + C_2 e^{-2x}$. Is it the most general solution? (Explain why.)

\subsection*{Solution}

The equation is a linear homogeneous second order ordinary differential equation.

Let $y = e^{ax}$, then

\[a^2 e^{ax} - 2a e^{ax} - 8 e^{ax} = 0\]
\[a^2 - 2a - 8 = 0\]

Solving this equation, we obtain the roots: $a = 4,\ a = -2$.

The partial solutions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $y_1 = C_1 e^{4x}$
    \item $y_2 = C_2 e^{-2x}$
\end{enumerate}

To find a general solution for initial equation, we will combine the partial two:

\[y = C_1 e^{4x} + C_2 e^{-2x}\]

Vectors $\begin{pmatrix}e^{4x} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix}0 \\ e^{-2x} \end{pmatrix}$ are linearly independent, hence they form a basis of the space of all particular solutions of given differential equation.

\subsection*{Answer}

Given solution is a general solution (shown above), and also it is the most general due to linear independency.
